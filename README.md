# Pocket++ `[work-in-progress]`
A web-app to extend Mozilla's Pocket for people dealing with dozens of saved content. 

Main features include:
* full list of saved (not archived) articles in form of sortable table
* time and count statistics - to track progress of reading and/or saving new stuff
  * idea that'll be implemented later: track count and time changes in InfluxDB
* random article selection - when you just can't decide
